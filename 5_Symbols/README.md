# Product Requirement: Scripts & Configuration Syntax Definition

## üß© Feature Name:
[e.g., "Cloudflared Tunnel Configuration Script", "Proxmox VM Backup Script Parameters", "YAML Syntax for Ingress Rules"]

## üéØ Objective:
To define the structure, parameters, and expected behavior of [e.g., "scripts used for automating tunnel creation/management"] or [e.g., "the configuration file syntax for defining service ingress rules"]. This ensures clarity for developers and users interacting with these symbolic representations or automated processes.

## üë§ User Stories:
- As a [user type, e.g., DevOps Engineer], I want to [action, e.g., use a script to create a new Cloudflare tunnel with predefined parameters], so that [benefit, e.g., I can automate deployments consistently].
- As a [user type, e.g., System Administrator], I want to [action, e.g., understand the YAML structure for defining ingress rules in `config.yml`], so that [benefit, e.g., I can correctly route traffic to my services].
- As a [user type, e.g., Developer], I want to [action, e.g., have a clear definition of environment variables a script accepts], so that [benefit, e.g., I can integrate it into CI/CD pipelines].
- ...

## üîÅ Acceptance Criteria:
Define what success looks like for scripts or configuration parsing.
- **Scenario 1:** [e.g., "Running Tunnel Creation Script"]
  - Given [I have set the `TUNNEL_NAME` and `SERVICE_URL` environment variables]
  - When [I execute `create_tunnel.sh`]
  - Then [a new Cloudflare tunnel with the specified name should be created]
  - And [it should be configured to point to the specified service URL]
  - And [the script should output the tunnel ID].
- **Scenario 2:** [e.g., "Validating `config.yml` Syntax"]
  - Given [a `config.yml` file with a correctly formatted ingress rule for `hostname: test.example.com` and `service: http://localhost:8080`]
  - When [the `cloudflared` service loads this configuration]
  - Then [the service should start without errors]
  - And [requests to `test.example.com` should be routed to `http://localhost:8080`].
- ...

## üõ†Ô∏è Functional Requirements:
- What are the inputs/parameters for the script or configuration?
  - [e.g., Script `setup_proxmox.sh` accepts `--ip <address>`, `--gateway <address>`, `--hostname <name>`.]
  - [e.g., `config.yml` `ingress` rule: `hostname` (string, required), `service` (string, required), `originRequest: { noTLSVerify: boolean, optional }`.]
- What actions does the script perform or what does the configuration define?
  - [e.g., The script installs `cloudflared`, authenticates, creates a tunnel, and configures it.]
  - [e.g., The `credentials-file` key in `config.yml` specifies the path to the tunnel's JSON credentials.]
- Any specific output or side effects?
  - [e.g., Script logs its actions to `stdout` and creates `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`.]
  - [e.g., Incorrect YAML syntax results in `cloudflared` service failure with a parsing error message.]

## üì¶ Non-functional Requirements:
- **Readability/Clarity:** [e.g., Scripts should be well-commented. YAML should be properly indented and human-readable.]
- **Error Handling (for scripts):** [e.g., Script should exit with a non-zero code on failure and print a descriptive error message.]
- **Idempotency (for scripts):** [e.g., Running the script multiple times with the same parameters should result in the same end state without error, if applicable.]
- **Security (for scripts):** [e.g., Avoid hardcoding secrets; use environment variables or secure input methods.]
- **Extensibility:** [e.g., Configuration syntax should allow for future additions without breaking backward compatibility if possible.]
- ...

## üß™ Edge Cases & Constraints:
- How does the script/parser handle invalid inputs or malformed configurations?
  - [e.g., Script validates input parameters and exits if they are missing or invalid.]
  - [e.g., `cloudflared` provides specific error messages for unknown keys or incorrect data types in `config.yml`.]
- Any dependencies for the script to run (e.g., `jq`, `curl`) or for the configuration to be valid (e.g., specific `cloudflared` version)?
  - [e.g., Script requires `bash` v4.0+ and `curl` to be installed.]
  - [e.g., `noTLSVerify` option in `config.yml` requires `cloudflared` version 202X.Y.Z+.]

## üîó Dependencies:
- **Services/APIs called by scripts:** [e.g., `cloudflared` CLI commands, Cloudflare API.]
- **File formats assumed:** [e.g., JSON for credentials file.]
- **Operating System features:** [e.g., `systemd` for service management by scripts.]

## üñºÔ∏è UI/UX (optional):
For CLI scripts, describe the command-line interface.
- **Command Syntax:** [e.g., `./my_script.sh [options] <argument>`]
- **Help Output:** [e.g., Script should have a `-h` or `--help` option displaying usage instructions.]

## üìä Metrics for Success:
How will you measure the effectiveness/usability of these scripts or configurations?
- [e.g., Successful execution rate of scripts in automated pipelines.]
- [e.g., Number of support issues or questions related to understanding the configuration syntax.]
- [e.g., Time saved by using automation scripts compared to manual processes.]
- [e.g., Adoption rate of the defined configuration standard across projects/teams.]
