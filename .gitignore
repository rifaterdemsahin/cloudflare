# Sensitive configuration files (beyond .env if any specific ones arise)

# The CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH variable points to a .json file,
# which is already covered by *.json.
# If there are other specific credential files created by scripts within the repo (unlikely for cf certs):
# Example:
# secret_key.pem
