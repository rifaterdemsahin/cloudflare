# ðŸ”’ Secure Files and Variables

This document outlines the sensitive variables and files that are crucial for the project's operation but should **never** be committed to the Git repository. These should be managed via a `.env` file at the root of the `5_Symbols/` directory, and the `.env` file itself must be listed in the project's `.gitignore` file.

## Environment Variables (.env) ðŸ”‘

The following variables are typically stored in `5_Symbols/.env` and are used by the scripts in the `5_Symbols/` directory:

-   `CF_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API Token.
    -   *Purpose*: Used for authenticating with the Cloudflare API for operations like tunnel creation and management.
    -   *Sensitivity*: High. Grants access to your Cloudflare account.
-   `ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare Account ID.
    -   *Purpose*: Specifies which Cloudflare account to use.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Medium. Identifies your account.
-   `TUNNEL_NAME`: A descriptive name for your Cloudflare tunnel (e.g., `proxmox-server`).
    -   *Purpose*: Used to identify and manage the tunnel.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Low.
-   `TUNNEL_ID`: The unique identifier for your Cloudflare tunnel.
    -   *Purpose*: Automatically generated by Cloudflare when a tunnel is created and used to route traffic.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Medium. Essential for tunnel operation.
    -   *Note*: This is often populated by the `create_cf_tunnel.sh` script.
-   `CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH`: The file system path to the tunnel's JSON credentials file.
    -   *Purpose*: Points to the file that authenticates the `cloudflared` daemon for a specific tunnel.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Path itself is low, but the file it points to is **very high**.
    -   *Note*: This is often populated by the `create_cf_tunnel.sh` script. The actual credentials file (e.g., `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.json`) should **never** be committed.
-   `DOMAIN_NAME`: Your registered main domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
    -   *Purpose*: Used to construct the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for services.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Low.
-   `SUBDOMAIN_NAME`: The subdomain for accessing your service (e.g., `proxmox`).
    -   *Purpose*: Used to construct the FQDN (e.g., `proxmox.example.com`).
    -   *Sensitivity*: Low.
-   `PROXMOX_IP`: The local network IP address of your Proxmox server.
    -   *Purpose*: The target IP for the Cloudflare tunnel ingress rule.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Medium. Exposes internal network information if leaked.
-   `PROXMOX_PORT`: The port number for your Proxmox web UI (typically `8006`).
    -   *Purpose*: The target port for the Cloudflare tunnel ingress rule.
    -   *Sensitivity*: Medium.

## Files to Ignore via `.gitignore` ðŸš«

1.  **`5_Symbols/.env`**: This file contains the actual values for the variables listed above. It is critical to add this to `.gitignore`.
2.  **Tunnel Credentials File (e.g., `~/.cloudflared/*.json` or `/root/.cloudflared/*.json`)**:
    -   These files (often named `<TUNNEL_ID>.json`) are generated by `cloudflared tunnel create` or `cloudflared tunnel login`. They contain the secret credentials for your tunnel.
    -   `cloudflared` typically stores these in a user's home directory (e.g., `~/.cloudflared/`) or `/root/.cloudflared/` if run as root.
    -   While not directly in the project repo, ensure these are not accidentally copied or backed up into any version-controlled location. The `CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH` variable in `.env` will point to its location.
3.  **`*.backup` files**: Scripts might create backup files (e.g., `config.yml.backup`). These should be ignored.
4.  **`*.log` files**: Any log files generated by scripts or services.
5.  **`*.tmp` or `*.temp` files**: Temporary files created during script execution.

Ensuring these variables and files are properly secured and ignored by Git is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your setup. Always use the `5_Symbols/.env.example` as a template for creating your local `5_Symbols/.env` file.Tool output for `create_file_with_block`:
