# Product Requirement: User Interface Definition

## üß© Feature Name:
[e.g., "Cloudflare Tunnel Setup Wizard UI", "Proxmox VM Creation Interface", "Host System Network Configuration Panel"]

## üéØ Objective:
To define the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for [specific task or platform, e.g., "configuring a Cloudflare tunnel via the dashboard"] or [e.g., "managing virtual machines in Proxmox"]. The goal is to ensure the interface is [e.g., "intuitive, efficient, and guides the user successfully through the setup/management process"].

## üë§ User Stories:
- As a [user type, e.g., Homelab Admin], I want to [action, e.g., easily add a new CNAME record in the Cloudflare dashboard for my tunnel], so that [benefit, e.g., I can quickly expose my service].
- As a [user type, e.g., New Proxmox User], I want to [action, e.g., clearly see the steps to create a new virtual machine], so that [benefit, e.g., I don't miss any crucial configuration settings].
- As a [user type, e.g., System Administrator], I want to [action, e.g., view the current status of my Cloudflared service on my host machine], so that [benefit, e.g., I can quickly troubleshoot connectivity issues].
- ...

## üîÅ Acceptance Criteria:
Define what success looks like for UI interactions. Use Gherkin-style (Given/When/Then) if possible.
- **Scenario 1:** [User attempts to complete a UI task, e.g., "Adding a proxmox hostname to Cloudflare tunnel"]
  - Given [I am on the Cloudflare dashboard tunnel configuration page]
  - When [I input 'proxmox.mydomain.com' as the hostname and 'https://local-proxmox-ip:8006' as the service]
  - And [I click 'Save']
  - Then [the UI should confirm the hostname is saved]
  - And [the new hostname should appear in the list of routed services for the tunnel].
- ...

## üõ†Ô∏è Functional Requirements:
- What should the user be able to see and do on this interface?
  - [e.g., Cloudflare: Display fields for Tunnel Name, Subdomain, Service URL, Origin SSL verification toggle.]
  - [e.g., Proxmox: Show options for OS type, disk size, memory allocation, network interface during VM creation.]
  - [e.g., Host CLI: Command `cloudflared tunnel list` should output all configured tunnels and their status.]
- Any validations or interactive feedback?
  - [e.g., Input fields should validate format (e.g., URL, IP address) and provide real-time feedback.]
  - [e.g., Buttons should be disabled until all required fields are filled.]
  - [e.g., Confirmation messages upon successful actions (e.g., "Tunnel created successfully").]

## üì¶ Non-functional Requirements:
- **Usability:** [e.g., The interface should be navigable using standard keyboard controls. Key tasks should be completable in X clicks/steps.]
- **Accessibility:** [e.g., Adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. Sufficient color contrast, screen reader compatibility.]
- **Responsiveness:** [e.g., (If applicable) The web interface should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.]
- **Performance:** [e.g., UI elements should load within X seconds. Interactions should feel immediate.]
- ...

## üß™ Edge Cases & Constraints:
- What happens if the user provides invalid input or tries an unexpected interaction?
  - [e.g., Display clear, inline error messages next to the problematic field.]
  - [e.g., Prevent submission if critical information is missing.]
- Any limitations of the platform's UI toolkit?
  - [e.g., Cloudflare dashboard might have specific styling or component limitations.]

## üîó Dependencies:
- **APIs:** [e.g., UI interactions will trigger calls to the Cloudflare API / Proxmox API.]
- **Other Systems:** [e.g., The UI might need to reflect status from the `cloudflared` service running on the host.]
- **Design Systems/Libraries:** [e.g., Adherence to Cloudflare's design system, or specific front-end libraries used.]

## üñºÔ∏è UI/UX (optional):
Describe user interactions or include mockup reference.
- **Reference:** [e.g., Screenshots of existing Cloudflare/Proxmox dashboards with annotations for the new feature.]
- **Mockups/Wireframes:** [e.g., Link to Figma/Sketch: link_to_design_files_for_this_ui]
- **User Flow Diagram:** [e.g., Visual representation of the steps a user takes to complete the task via the UI.]

## üìä Metrics for Success:
How will you measure if the UI is effective?
- [e.g., Task completion rate for the specific UI flow (e.g., setting up a tunnel).]
- [e.g., Time taken to complete the task using the UI.]
- [e.g., Reduction in user errors or support requests related to this UI section.]
- [e.g., User satisfaction scores (e.g., via surveys) for this interface.]
