# Product Requirement: Core Feature Definition

## 🧩 Feature Name:
[Specify the Core Product Feature, e.g., "User Authentication System", "Data Processing Pipeline"]

## 🎯 Objective:
To clearly define [problem this feature solves, e.g., "the need for secure user access"] and outline why it's critical for [overall product goal, e.g., "protecting user data and enabling personalized experiences"]. This document serves as the source of truth for this feature's development.

## 👤 User Stories:
- As a [user type, e.g., End User], I want to [action, e.g., securely log in], so that [benefit, e.g., I can access my account].
- As a [user type, e.g., Administrator], I want to [action, e.g., manage user roles], so that [benefit, e.g., I can control access levels].
- ...

## 🔁 Acceptance Criteria:
Define what success looks like. Use Gherkin-style (Given/When/Then) if possible.
- **Scenario 1:** [Scenario Name]
  - Given [precondition]
  - When [action is performed]
  - Then [expected outcome]
- ...

## 🛠️ Functional Requirements:
- What should the system do?
  - [e.g., The system shall allow users to register with an email and password.]
  - [e.g., The system shall encrypt passwords using bcrypt.]
- Any validations or rules?
  - [e.g., Password must be at least 8 characters long.]
  - [e.g., Email must be a valid format.]

## 📦 Non-functional Requirements:
- **Performance:** [e.g., Login response time should be < 500ms for 99% of requests.]
- **Reliability:** [e.g., System uptime should be 99.9%.]
- **Security:** [e.g., All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Comply with GDPR.]
- **Scalability:** [e.g., The system should support 10,000 concurrent users.]
- **Usability:** [e.g., The registration process should be intuitive and completable within 2 minutes.]
- ...

## 🧪 Edge Cases & Constraints:
- What should NOT happen?
  - [e.g., Users should not be able to register with an already existing email.]
  - [e.g., System should gracefully handle login attempts with incorrect credentials without revealing if the username exists.]
- Any limitations?
  - [e.g., Maximum 3 failed login attempts before temporary account lockout.]
  - [e.g., Feature relies on a third-party email verification service which has a rate limit of X emails/hour.]

## 🔗 Dependencies:
- **APIs:** [e.g., Email Verification API, Payment Gateway API]
- **Databases:** [e.g., PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for session management]
- **Other Systems:** [e.g., Logging infrastructure, Monitoring tools]

## 🖼️ UI/UX (optional):
Describe user interactions or include mockup reference.
- [e.g., Refer to Figma mockups: link_to_figma_project/page]
- [e.g., Login page will have fields for username/email and password, a 'Forgot Password' link, and a 'Sign Up' link.]

## 📊 Metrics for Success:
How will you measure if the feature works well?
- [e.g., Successful user registration rate: target 95%.]
- [e.g., Daily active users (DAU) utilizing the feature.]
- [e.g., Reduction in support tickets related to this feature by X%.]
- [e.g., Task completion time for key user stories.]
