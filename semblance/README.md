# Product Requirement: System State & Error Handling Definition

## üß© Feature Name:
[e.g., "Define Graceful Error Handling for [Service/Module]", "Specify System State Representation for [Component]", "Model User Session Lifecycle"]

## üéØ Objective:
To clearly define [e.g., "how the system should represent different states (e.g., loading, error, success) for [Component/Service]"] or [e.g., "how [Service/Module] should behave in the event of [specific error types or unexpected conditions]"] to ensure [e.g., "a predictable user experience and robust system behavior"]. This helps in building resilient and understandable systems.

## üë§ User Stories:
- As a [user type, e.g., Developer], I want to [action, e.g., have clear definitions for error states], so that [benefit, e.g., I can implement consistent error handling logic].
- As a [user type, e.g., End User], I want to [action, e.g., see informative error messages when something goes wrong], so that [benefit, e.g., I understand the issue and how to proceed].
- As a [user type, e.g., System Operator], I want to [action, e.g., easily identify the system's current operational state through logs/monitoring], so that [benefit, e.g., I can diagnose issues quickly].
- ...

## üîÅ Acceptance Criteria:
Define what success looks like. Use Gherkin-style (Given/When/Then) if possible.
- **Scenario 1:** [Specific Error Condition or State Transition]
  - Given [system is in a specific state / specific error occurs]
  - When [triggering action/event]
  - Then [the system should transition to X state / display Y error message / log Z information]
- ...

## üõ†Ô∏è Functional Requirements:
- What should the system do in various states or error conditions?
  - [e.g., Upon API timeout, the system shall display a 'Request Timed Out' message to the user and offer a retry option.]
  - [e.g., The system shall log all critical errors with a unique transaction ID and relevant context.]
  - [e.g., Define specific error codes/types (e.g., ERR_NETWORK, ERR_INVALID_INPUT, STATE_PROCESSING, STATE_COMPLETED).]
- Any validations or rules for state transitions or error propagation?
  - [e.g., An order cannot transition from 'Processing' back to 'Pending Review'.]
  - [e.g., User-facing error messages must not expose sensitive system details.]

## üì¶ Non-functional Requirements:
- **Clarity:** [e.g., Error messages should be understandable by non-technical users.]
- **Consistency:** [e.g., Similar errors across different modules should be handled and presented uniformly.]
- **Loggability:** [e.g., All state transitions and significant errors must be logged with sufficient detail for debugging.]
- **Recoverability:** [e.g., For transient errors, the system should attempt X retries with exponential backoff.]
- ...

## üß™ Edge Cases & Constraints:
- What specific unexpected inputs or race conditions need to be modeled or handled?
  - [e.g., Handling of concurrent requests trying to modify the same resource state.]
  - [e.g., System behavior when a dependent service returns an unexpected error format.]
- Any limitations in error detection or state representation?
  - [e.g., Inability to distinguish between certain downstream failures.]

## üîó Dependencies:
- **APIs:** [e.g., How errors from external APIs are mapped to internal error states.]
- **Databases:** [e.g., How database connection failures or transaction rollbacks are handled and represented.]
- **Other Systems:** [e.g., Logging/Monitoring systems used to track states and errors.]

## üñºÔ∏è UI/UX (optional):
Describe user interactions for error states or state indicators.
- [e.g., Error messages will be displayed in a non-intrusive banner at the top of the page.]
- [e.g., Loading states will be indicated by a spinner icon on the affected component.]
- [e.g., Refer to Figma mockups for error dialogs: link_to_figma_project/error_states]

## üìä Metrics for Success:
How will you measure the effectiveness of error handling and state management?
- [e.g., Reduction in unhandled exceptions in production logs.]
- [e.g., Increased success rate of user operations after implementing clearer error guidance.]
- [e.g., Faster mean time to resolution (MTTR) for issues due to better state logging.]
- [e.g., User-reported confusion regarding system status or errors decreases.]
