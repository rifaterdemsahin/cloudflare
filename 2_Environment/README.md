# Product Requirement: Environment Configuration Definition

## üß© Feature Name:
[e.g., "Homelab Server Base Configuration", "Cloudflare Tunnel Service Environment Variables", "Proxmox Host Network Settings"]

## üéØ Objective:
To define the specific configurations, settings, references, and environmental prerequisites for [e.g., "setting up and running the Cloudflared service reliably"] or [e.g., "ensuring proper network communication for the Proxmox host"]. This ensures consistency and reproducibility across setups or deployments.

## üë§ User Stories:
- As a [user type, e.g., System Administrator], I want to [action, e.g., have a clear list of required packages and their versions for the homelab server], so that [benefit, e.g., I can prepare the server environment correctly].
- As a [user type, e.g., Developer], I want to [action, e.g., know the necessary environment variables for configuring the application in staging vs. production], so that [benefit, e.g., I can deploy and test accurately].
- As a [user type, e.g., Homelab User], I want to [action, e.g., understand the recommended firewall rules for my Proxmox host], so that [benefit, e.g., I can secure my environment while allowing necessary traffic].
- ...

## üîÅ Acceptance Criteria:
Define what a correctly configured environment looks like.
- **Scenario 1:** [e.g., "Validating Cloudflared Service Configuration"]
  - Given [the `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml` file exists and is populated according to specification]
  - And [the `cloudflared` service is installed]
  - When [I run `cloudflared tunnel list`]
  - Then [the output should show the configured tunnel with a 'healthy' status].
- **Scenario 2:** [e.g., "Proxmox Host Network Check"]
  - Given [the Proxmox host network interfaces are configured as per `/etc/network/interfaces` specification]
  - When [I ping the gateway IP from the Proxmox host]
  - Then [I should receive a successful reply].
- ...

## üõ†Ô∏è Functional Requirements:
- What specific settings, files, or system states define this environment?
  - [e.g., Cloudflared: Contents of `config.yml` (tunnel ID, credentials file path, ingress rules).]
  - [e.g., Proxmox Host: Static IP configuration, DNS servers, bridge interface setup in `/etc/network/interfaces`.]
  - [e.g., Ubuntu Server: Required packages (`curl`, `sudo`, `systemd`), specific kernel parameters.]
- Any scripts or commands to apply/verify configurations?
  - [e.g., `sudo systemctl enable cloudflared && sudo systemctl start cloudflared` to ensure service runs on boot.]
  - [e.g., Reference to a bash script that checks for all required dependencies.]

## üì¶ Non-functional Requirements:
- **Security:** [e.g., File permissions for configuration files (e.g., `credentials-file` should be readable only by root).]
- **Reliability:** [e.g., Configuration should ensure services restart automatically on failure or reboot.]
- **Maintainability:** [e.g., Configuration files should be well-commented. Version control for key config files.]
- **Idempotency:** [e.g., (If applicable) Configuration scripts should be runnable multiple times without adverse effects.]
- ...

## üß™ Edge Cases & Constraints:
- What happens if a required configuration is missing or incorrect?
  - [e.g., Cloudflared service fails to start and logs an error indicating misconfiguration.]
  - [e.g., Proxmox host loses network connectivity.]
- Any hardware/software version constraints?
  - [e.g., Requires Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.]
  - [e.g., Cloudflared version X.Y.Z or newer.]
  - [e.g., Minimum RAM/CPU for the host system.]

## üîó Dependencies:
- **External Services:** [e.g., Access to Cloudflare services, DNS resolution from GoDaddy.]
- **Hardware:** [e.g., Specific network card features required for Proxmox passthrough.]
- **Software:** [e.g., `cloudflared` binary, `dpkg` for installation.]
- **Documentation:** [e.g., Links to official Cloudflare/Proxmox documentation for specific settings.]

## üñºÔ∏è UI/UX (optional):
Not typically applicable for environment configurations unless there's a management interface for them.
- [e.g., If a script provides interactive setup, describe its prompts and outputs.]

## üìä Metrics for Success:
How will you measure if the environment is correctly and effectively configured?
- [e.g., Successful deployment/setup rate on first attempt using these definitions.]
- [e.g., Stability of services running in this environment (e.g., uptime of `cloudflared` service).]
- [e.g., Time taken to set up a new environment based on these specifications.]
- [e.g., Reduction in configuration-related support issues.]
